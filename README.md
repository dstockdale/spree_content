SpreeContent
============

Introduction goes here.

Installation
------------

Add spree_content to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'spree_content'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g spree_content:install
```

The catch-all route that serves up the static pages will not be added automatically so you need to add the following yourself and make sure it's the last entry in your routes file.

config/routes.rb

```ruby
get '*path', :to => 'spree/static_contents#show', :as => 'static'
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_content/factories'
```
